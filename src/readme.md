# online store webpage

In this project the purpose was to design a webpage, gain practice in how to structure a webpage using HTML and CSS. I made a 3 paged webstore, contining a simple home page, product page and order page. The different pages are conected thorugh link and button.

## project description

the project showcase a single procut of earings from Pilgrim. I took some inspiration from their official webpage while making my own. when you open the index.html the button "Go to product" sends you to the next page, wich is the product page. Here you can view the earings i decided to make a webpage for. It contains 3 picures and 1 video, title, a paragraph and a list of details about the product. There are two buttons on the page, the "Go to order" takes you to order.html. the second button is does not have any click reaction.

Inside navbar there are only to reactive icons: return icon and cart icon. Return icon takes you back to the previus page you were on. cart icon takes you to the order.html.

None of the liks in footer linked to anywere.
